Installation
============

To install pydirect you will need the following prerequisites:

* python 2.6+
* numpy
* C++ compiler
* FORTRAN compiler

`Python(x,y) <http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_ is a great way to get all
of these if you are using windows and satisfied with 32bit.

Download the source files of pydirect, unzip, and then execute::

    $ python setup.py install

You can test the installation by running the examples under the folder ``test/``.
Some of the examples require `matplotlib <http://http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`.
